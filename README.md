# Impact of *dhps* mutations on sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine protective efficacy and implications for malaria chemoprevention
:mosquito:ðŸ¦Ÿ:test_tube:ðŸ§ª:dna: ðŸ§¬
 
## Overview
This repository contains the code used to analyse data on new infections from sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) alone or in combination with artesunate (AS). 
The corresponding scientific article is available at: https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4856036
The code and data to reproduce all figures presented in main text, and supplementary information of the associated publication is available within this repository.

## Repo Contents
- [data](./data): this folder includes the data required to reproduce the analysis and results. This includes **combined_data.csv** (new infection data for all studies) and **day0_frequencies**. It also includes **Data_dictionary.doc**.
- **deterministic_combined_all.stan**: this file is the deterministic model file writtern in rstan. 
- **R_script_combined_all.R** : this file is the R script which pools and analyses data from all studies using **deterministic_combined_all.stan**. This includes:
 --reading in data and converting to model inputs 
 --running stan model 
 --checking model diagnostics (including R-hat and ESS)
 --traceplots and correlation plots (not presented in the manuscript)
 --summarizing model outputs: median and 95%Credible Intervals of estimated parameters (presented in the manuscript and supplementary materials)
 --calculation of the mean duration of protection using estimated shape and scale parameters (and median & 95%Credible intervals across 10000 iterations)
- **model_all_combined.RData**: this file stores the model (MCMC) outputs produced using **R_script_combined_all.R**. 
- **Figures**: this folder contains code related to figures presented in the main manuscript and supplementary infromation. These are using both data and outputs from the model and include:
 -- reading in model predictions (from stan model generated quantities)
 -- for each arm and site generates predicted proportion reinfected vs observed proportion reinfected (by genotype)
 -- supplementary plot of day 0 frequency vs posterior distribution of genotype frequency by trial site
 -- plots of protective efficacy over time since treatment (for SP/SPAS and additional arms where available)

 
## Software Requirements
Running the code contained in this repository requires the following:
- The R Programming Language (Version 4.3.1 used here) 
- The packages **ggplot2**, **cowplot**, **dplyr**, **bayesplot**, **DescTools**    
- The package **rstan** :  This work utilises the probabilistic programming language Stan for model fitting (implemented in R via the package rstan). Stan is a program for analysis of Bayesian models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. More information and details about the software and its use via R are available here: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki . Guidelines on how to install rstan can be found here: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started .
 ## Installation Guide and Instructions for Use
The following instructions require that all the relevant `R` packages have been installed by the user and that rstan has been installed. To replicate and reproduce the analyses presented in this paper, do the following: 
1. Clone this Github repository and make a local copy on your desktop.
2. Run the `R` code scripts for the particular part of the analysis you are trying to reproduce.
